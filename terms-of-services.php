    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> [07/10/2024]</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using the Tahcoin DEX, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and any additional policies or guidelines that may be posted on our platform.</p>

    <h2>2. Full Decentralization</h2>
    <p>Tahcoin DEX operates as a fully decentralized exchange. Users do not need to create any accounts; instead, trades are conducted peer-to-peer using the keys from your cryptocurrency wallet. We do not maintain any jurisdictional ties and will not be held accountable under any legal frameworks for damages or losses incurred while using our platform. All transactions are peer-to-peer, and users engage in trading at their own risk.</p>

    <h2>3. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>You must be at least 18 years old or the age of majority in your jurisdiction to use our services. However, due to the decentralized nature of our platform, we do not have measures in place to prevent users under 18 from accessing our services. While we recommend that users be at least 18 years old, we do not enforce this requirement.</p>

    <h2>4. Services Offered</h2>
    <p>The Tahcoin DEX allows users to trade Tahcoin (TAH) with USDT in a decentralized manner. Our platform does not facilitate fiat transactions, and all trades are conducted in cryptocurrency.</p>

    <h2>5. Private Key Management</h2>
    <p>When you initiate a trade on the Tahcoin DEX, we temporarily store your private keys to facilitate the transaction. Upon successful completion of the trade, these keys are deleted from our servers. If, during this process, your keys become exposed due to any reason, Tahcoin DEX shall not be held responsible for any resulting losses or damages. We strongly recommend that users utilize temporary wallets for trading on the Tahcoin DEX.</p>

    <h2>6. Trading Risks</h2>
    <p>Trading cryptocurrencies involves substantial risk and may not be suitable for every investor. You should carefully consider whether trading is appropriate for you based on your financial situation and risk tolerance.</p>

    <h2>7. No Fees</h2>
    <p>The Tahcoin DEX does not charge any trading fees or withdrawal fees. All transactions are conducted without additional costs to users.</p>

    <h2>8. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree not to engage in any prohibited activities, including but not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using the platform for illegal purposes.</li>
        <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to our systems or networks.</li>
        <li>Spreading malware or engaging in any form of cyber attack.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Tahcoin DEX shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of or inability to use our services.</p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Tahcoin DEX and its affiliates from any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use of our services or violation of these Terms.</p>

    <h2>11. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service at any time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting on our platform. Your continued use of the Tahcoin DEX after changes are made constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws applicable in a decentralized context; thus, no specific jurisdiction applies.</p>
