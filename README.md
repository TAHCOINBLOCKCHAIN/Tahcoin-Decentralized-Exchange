### Creating a New Wallet

1. **Create a New Wallet**: It is highly recommended to create a new wallet specifically for use with the Tahcoin DEX. This helps to isolate your trading activities from your main wallet, enhancing security.

2. **Use a Trusted Wallet Provider**: Choose a reputable wallet provider that supports Tahcoin. Follow their instructions to create a new wallet, ensuring you securely store your recovery phrase or private keys.

### Managing Your Tahcoin

- **Deposit Only What You Need**: When using the DEX, only send the amount of Tahcoin you plan to trade into your DEX wallet. This minimizes exposure and reduces the risk of loss.

- **Avoid Long-Term Storage**: Do not keep large amounts of Tahcoin in your DEX wallet for prolonged periods. After completing your trades, transfer any remaining balance back to your main wallet for safekeeping.
